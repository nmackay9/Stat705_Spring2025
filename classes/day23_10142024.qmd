## Quick recap about model selection   

- We want to select simple but complex enough models.  
- Assumptions should be as realistic as possible.  
- Usually, predictive ability is desired.  
  - At what cost? - evaluate model fit adding a penalty for each parameter  
  - Isn't it unfair to use the data twice? - out-of-sample prediction accuracy
    - e.g., cross-validation (k-fold/leave-one-out)
