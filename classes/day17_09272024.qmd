**ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND**

$$\mathbf{y} \sim \text{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \sigma^2\mathbf{I}),$$

$$\boldsymbol{\mu} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}.$$
  
- Linearity\
-   Homoscedasticity (i.e., constant variance)\
-   Residuals are iid $\sim N(0, \sigma^2)$  
    - Independent\  
    - Normally distributed
