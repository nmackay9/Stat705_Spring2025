## From last class

-   Think of your project topic!

-   Talk to us if you need data. Check out [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/), [this R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/agridat/index.html).

-   About R versus SAS, versus python...

-   [Assignment 1](https://jlacasa.github.io/stat705_fall2024/assignments/hw1) is due next Wednesday 28th.

## Intro to statistical modeling

### Mental checklist:

1.  What is the problem or question? (what is the objective?)
2.  How is the data generated?

### Short story

#### My dad wants to grow clover in our farm and has different species to pick from.

> 2. How is the data generated?

#### The data

We planted three different legume species and waited two months for them to grow.

## Data generating process

To the whiteboard!

## Fitting the model to data

Live R session

See code [here](https://github.com/jlacasa/stat705_fall2024/tree/main/classes/in_class_code/day2_inclass.Rmd).

## For next class:

-   Read Chapter 2 from the book.

-   Think of your project topic!

-   Schedule a 15-min meeting and we can chat about your project.
